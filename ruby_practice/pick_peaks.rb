# Pick peaks

# In this kata, you will write a function that returns the positions and the values
# of the "peaks" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.

# For example, the array arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0] has a peak at position 3 with
# a value of 5 (since arr[3] equals 5).

# The output will be returned as an object with two properties: pos and peaks.
# Both of these properties should be arrays. If there is no peak in the given array,
# then the output should be {pos: [], peaks: []}.

# Example: pickPeaks([3, 2, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3]) should
# return {pos: [3, 7], peaks: [6, 3]} (or equivalent in other languages)

# All input arrays will be valid integer arrays (although it could still be empty),
# so you won't need to validate the input.

# The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks
# (in the context of a mathematical function, we don't know what is after and
# before and therefore, we don't know if it is a peak or not).

# Also, beware of plateaus !!! [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] has a peak while [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
# does not. In case of a plateau-peak, please only return the position
# and value of the beginning of the plateau. For example: pickPeaks([1, 2, 2, 2, 1])
# returns {pos: [1], peaks: [2]} (or equivalent in other languages)
####
# i: array of numbers, could be empty
# o: hash with pos: an array of (first) position/index of peak
#             peaks: an array of peak values corresponding with the indexes
# p: - find a place in the arry where number before is lower and number after is lower or
# the same = peak
#   - save peak and index in hash
#   -start looking from index 2 and stop looking from index lenght -2
#   - but if the array.lenght < 3 don't bother and return empty arrays (make that the default)
# f: - check length of array and if < 3 return default
#   - loop from index 2 to index len -2
#       - compare value with value of index -1.
#         if bigger:
#           - compare value with value of index + 1
#           if bigger -> peak , write to hash
#       else: next
#     - output the hash

#### NB: passes test but not on codewars. I think because the output needs to be an object
# with 2 properties. Which I don't know how to do yet...
